<h1 id="skupper-overview">Skupper overview</h1>

<p>Hybrid clouds enable organizations to combine on-premise, private
cloud, and public cloud resources. While such a solution provides many
benefits, it also presents a unique challenge: enabling these
resources to communicate with each other.</p>

<p>Skupper provides a solution to this challenge with a Virtual
Application Network that simply and securely connects applications
running in different network locations.</p>

<h2 id="virtual-application-networks">Virtual Application Networks</h2>

<p>Skupper solves multi-cluster communication challenges through
something called a Virtual Application Network (VAN). To understand
the value of Skupper, it is helpful to first understand what a VAN is.</p>

<p>A VAN connects the applications and services in your hybrid cloud into
a virtual network so that they can communicate with each other as if
they were all running in the same site. In this diagram, a VAN
connects three services, each of which is running in a different
cloud:</p>

<p><img class="diagram" src="https://skupper.io/images/overview-clouds.png"/></p>

<p>In essence, the VAN connects the services in a distributed application
with a microservice architecture.</p>

<p><img class="diagram" src="https://skupper.io/images/overview-application.png"/></p>

<p>VANs are able to provide connectivity across the hybrid cloud because
they operate at Layer 7 (the application layer). They use <strong>Layer 7
application routers</strong> to route communication between <strong>Layer 7 application
addresses</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="layer-7-application-routers">Layer 7 application routers</h2>

<p>Layer 7 application routers form the backbone of a VAN in the same way
that conventional network routers form the backbone of a VPN. However,
instead of routing IP packets between network endpoints, Layer 7
application routers route messages between application endpoints
(called Layer 7 application addresses).</p>

<h2 id="layer-7-application-addresses">Layer 7 application addresses</h2>

<p>A Layer 7 application address represents an endpoint, or destination
in the VAN. When an application sends a communication to an address,
the Layer 7 application routers distribute the communication to any
other application in the VAN that has the same address.</p>

<p>For example, in this diagram, <strong>Service B</strong> sends a message with an
application address to its local application router. <strong>Service A</strong> and
<strong>Service C</strong> are subscribed to the same address, so the application
router routes copies of the message through the VAN until they arrive
at each destination.</p>

<p><img class="diagram" src="https://skupper.io/images/overview-routers.png"/></p>

<p>VANs provide multiple routing patterns, so communications can be
distributed in anycast (balanced or closest) or multicast patterns.</p>

<h2 id="skupper">Skupper</h2>

<p>Skupper is an open source tool for creating VANs in Kubernetes. By
using Skupper, you can create a distributed application comprised of
microservices running in different Kubernetes clusters.</p>

<p>This diagram illustrates a Skupper network that connects three
services running in three different Kubernetes clusters:</p>

<p><img class="diagram" src="https://skupper.io/images/overview-clusters.png"/></p>

<p>In a Skupper network, each namespace contains a Skupper instance. When
these Skupper instances connect, they continually share information
about the services that each instance exposes. This means that each
Skupper instance is always aware of every service that has been
exposed to the Skupper network, regardless of the namespace in which
each service resides.</p>

<p>Once a Skupper network is formed across Kubernetes namespaces, any of
the services in those namespaces can be exposed (through annotation)
to the Skupper network. When a service is exposed, Skupper creates
proxy endpoints to make that service available on each namespace in
the Skupper network.</p>
